## Being a Host
First of all, we are super excited about you wanting to host an event! Without hosts
we would not be able to have these great events and build this awesome community. 

With that said, being a host comes with some responsibilites. We've gone ahead and listed
both requirements and suggestions below to help you understand what's expected of you if you
host.

### Requirements
* If you want to hold an intro talk please keep it to a maximum of 1 minutes
* Space for at least 50 people
* Location is easy to get to with public transportation from Stockholm City
* Projector or a big tv to put the slides on
* Food
* Drinks

### Nice to have
* Some form of microphone our sound setup
* Windows capable of actually being opened (don't ask....)
* A greeter at the entrance to make sure people feel welcomed
* Note with WiFi password / other important information
