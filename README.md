# About Stockholm React JS

Stockholm React JS is a community of people in Stockholm interested in the web framework React.

This repository is only here to act as a presentation of the group on GitHub, read on below and we will try to guide you to where you want to go.

## Let us guide you right

We are still in the process of setting up our online community and things like a website are still missing. Feel free to check back here later, or open an issue if there is something specific you are missing from the list!

That's great! We try to be as transparent as possible and use GitHub for most things. Browse around in our different repositories and read some issues and pull requests to get a sense for what is going on right now. Feel free to join the discussion anywhere and help out where you see fit.

For more information, visit our [governance-repository](https://github.com/stockholm-react-js/governance) where we keep everything not related specifically to meetups and events.
